This is TinkerKitIRremote library for Arduino

It's a simplified and wrapped version of shirriff/Arduino-IRremote

i.e. you don't create object from IRrecv class and call methods of them, instead you call the wrapper functions. Everything is much simplier!

The class is made so it only fits with TinkerKit remote controllers sold in Arduino store. In this way it saves quite a few bytes after compilation, you can use these precious bytes for more important stuff.

There's also definitions of button codes, for the TinkerKit controllers.


Below is the original README
**********************************************

This is the IRremote library for the Arduino.

To download from github (http://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote), click on the "Downloads" link in the upper right, click "Download as zip", and get a zip file.  Unzip it and rename the directory shirriff-Arduino-IRremote-nnn to IRremote

To install, move the downloaded IRremote directory to:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote
where arduino-1.x is your Arduino installation directory

After installation you should have files such as:
arduino-1.x/libraries/IRremote/IRremote.cpp

For details on the library see the Wiki on github or the blog post http://arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html
